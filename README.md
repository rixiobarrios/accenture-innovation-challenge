# Innovator Showcase

### Tool or Technology:

Phind; A free generative AI search engine for developers.

### Overview

Phind is a conversational search engine for developers. It combines web results with generative AI to give you answers, code examples, and guides. Phind understands and follows your conversation and technical questions.

### How I learned about it  

I was introduced to Phind in a seminar regarding the intelligent use of AI at work.

### Every day Applications  

- Learn about a new technology  
- Read documentation or references to current technology  
- Check for syntax errors, redundant and inefficient code 
- Research a basic feature or functionality

The following information was generated by Phind when asked to build a game of rock, paper, scissors in C#:

To code a rock paper scissors game in C#, you can follow these steps:

- Create a console application in C#.  
- Define the three options: rock, paper, and scissors as constants.  
- Prompt the user to enter their choice (rock, paper, or scissors).  
- Generate a random choice for the computer.  
- Compare the user's choice with the computer's choice to determine the winner.  
- Display the result to the user.  
- Ask the user if they want to play again.  
- Repeat the game until the user chooses to exit. 

### Here is an example implementation:
```
using System;

namespace RockPaperScissors
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            const string Rock = "rock";
            const string Paper = "paper";
            const string Scissors = "scissors";

            bool playAgain = true;

            while (playAgain)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Rock, Paper, or Scissors?");
                string userChoice = Console.ReadLine().ToLower();

                Random random = new Random();
                int computerChoice = random.Next(1, 4);

                string computerChoiceString = computerChoice switch
                {
                    1 => Rock,
                    2 => Paper,
                    3 => Scissors,
                    _ => throw new InvalidOperationException()
                };

                Console.WriteLine($"Computer chose: {computerChoiceString}");

                if (userChoice == computerChoiceString)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine("It's a tie!");
                }
                else if ((userChoice == Rock && computerChoiceString == Scissors) ||
                         (userChoice == Paper && computerChoiceString == Rock) ||
                         (userChoice == Scissors && computerChoiceString == Paper))
                {
                    Console.WriteLine("You win!");
                }
                else
                {
                    Console.WriteLine("Computer wins!");
                }

                Console.WriteLine("Do you want to play again? (yes/no)");
                string playAgainChoice = Console.ReadLine().ToLower();
                playAgain = playAgainChoice == "yes";

                Console.WriteLine();
            }
        }
    }
}

```
